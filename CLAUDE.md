# CLAUDE.md – AI Agent Instructions

**Filename:** This file must be named **CLAUDE.md** (all caps) in the project root so Cursor and other tools load it as the project’s agent instructions.

This file contains instructions for AI agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) working on projects that use this boilerplate.

---

## Project Overview

- **What this project does:** A NYC-specific residential real estate deal tracker for value-add investors. Ingests foreclosure and tax lien data from NYC Open Data, displays deals as filterable property cards, maps them geographically, and tracks them through a personal investment pipeline.
- **Tech stack:** Python, Streamlit (app/frontend), Supabase (PostgreSQL), pydeck (maps), NYC Open Data API, Streamlit Community Cloud (deployment)
- **Primary user (v1):** A single NYC real estate investor focused on value-add, distressed/foreclosure, and assemblage opportunities
- **Key features:** Deal discovery feed, filters, map view, pipeline tracking (Watching → Analyzing → Offer Made → Dead), manual deal entry
- **Specs or docs:** `docs/nyc-real-estate-competitive-analysis.md`

## Project Structure

```
app/
  main.py                    # Streamlit entry point — run with: .venv/bin/streamlit run app/main.py
data/
  schema.sql                 # Supabase schema (already applied)
  ingest_nyc_open_data.py    # NYC Open Data ingestion (TES-7)
utils/
  config.py                  # Env var loading
  supabase_client.py         # Cached Supabase client
requirements.txt             # Python deps — install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
.env                         # Local secrets (gitignored) — needs SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_KEY
```

## Database Schema (Supabase)

Two tables already created:
- **properties** — address, borough, property_type, deal_type (foreclosure/tax_lien/listing/off_market), price, sqft, lat, lng, source
- **deals** — property_id (FK), status (watching/analyzing/offer_made/dead), notes

3 sample properties seeded for testing (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx).

## Running the App

```bash
.venv/bin/streamlit run app/main.py
```

## Key Decisions

1. **Streamlit over Next.js** — speed. 1-week mockup. Can migrate later.
2. **NYC Open Data first** — free, legal. PropertyShark deferred.
3. **No AI zoning in v1** — deferred until usage data is collected.
4. **Supabase free tier** — sufficient for v1 single-user.

## Important: Loading .env for bin/ticket

`bin/ticket` doesn't auto-load `.env`. Source it manually:
```bash
set -a && source .env && set +a && bash bin/ticket list
```

---

## Language-Agnostic Tooling

**This boilerplate works with any programming language.** The CLI tools (`bin/vibe`, `bin/ticket`) are written in Python, but they're workflow automation that runs **alongside** your project, not part of it.

**If the project uses JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, or any other language:**
- The Python tooling is for workflow automation only (tickets, worktrees, PR policies)
- No Python dependencies are added to your project's package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, etc.
- Your app's build, test, and deploy processes are unchanged
- When writing code, use the project's actual language and frameworks

**Example:** A Next.js project using this boilerplate:
- App code: TypeScript/React
- Tests: Jest or Vitest
- Build: `npm run build`
- Workflow tooling: `bin/vibe do PROJ-123` (Python, but doesn't affect your app)

---

## Multi-Assistant Support

This boilerplate supports multiple AI coding assistants. A single source of truth in `agent_instructions/` generates format-specific files for:

| Assistant | File Generated |
|-----------|----------------|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Cursor IDE | `.cursor/rules` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |

### Maintaining Instructions

Edit the source files in `agent_instructions/`:
- `CORE.md` - Project context and core rules
- `COMMANDS.md` - Available commands
- `WORKFLOW.md` - Standard workflows

Then regenerate assistant files:

```bash
bin/vibe generate-agent-instructions
```

### Source File Format

The source files use simple markdown:

```markdown
# CORE.md
## Project Overview
- **Name**: My Project
- **Description**: What it does

## Core Rules
- Read files before modifying
- Use existing patterns

## Anti-Patterns
- Guessing file contents
- Over-engineering
```

See `agent_instructions/` for the full template.

## Before You Build: Validate Your Idea

**For vibe coders who prompt faster than they think.** Before investing time building something, use `/assess` to validate that it's worth building.

### When to Use `/assess`

| Situation | Use `/assess`? |
|-----------|---------------|
| Starting a new app or significant feature | **Yes** |
| Building something that might already exist | **Yes** |
| Pivoting an existing project | **Yes** |
| Learning project / tutorial | Optional |
| Bug fix or small improvement | No |
| Client project with defined requirements | No |

### What `/assess` Does

1. **Understands your idea** through interactive Q&A
2. **Researches competitors** via web search (with your consent)
3. **Identifies market gaps** you could fill
4. **Challenges your assumptions** with hard questions
5. **Recommends**: Proceed / Reconsider / Pivot

### Example

```
You: I want to build an AI-powered todo app

/assess

[Interactive session: questions about problem, users, differentiation]
[Web research: finds Todoist AI, Motion, Reclaim.ai, etc.]
[Analysis: existing solutions are mature, market is crowded]

Recommendation: RECONSIDER
- Todoist already has AI prioritization
- Motion does AI scheduling well
- Consider: What's your 10x differentiator?
- Alternative: Build a plugin for existing tool instead?
```

### Works on Existing Projects

Running `/assess` on an existing project will:
- Read your codebase to understand what you've built
- Check if the competitive landscape has changed
- Help you decide: double down, pivot, or sunset

---

## README Maintenance

Keep the project **README.md** accurate so humans and agents can onboard quickly.

### When a new app is initialized (from a prompt or setup)

After creating or configuring a new project, update **README.md** with:

- **App name and description** – What the project does and who it’s for
- **Tech stack** – Frameworks, runtimes, databases, deployment (align with Project Overview in this file)
- **Setup instructions** – Prerequisites, install steps, env vars, how to run locally
- **Project structure** – Short overview of key directories (e.g. `api/`, `ui/`, `scripts/`)

If the user ran `bin/vibe setup`, remind them to update README as part of the “next steps” (see setup wizard).

### Continuous maintenance

As the project evolves, keep README in sync:

- **New features** – Document user-facing or notable capabilities
- **Setup steps** – Refine when install/run steps change
- **Architecture changes** – Update structure or diagrams when layout or responsibilities change

When you add a new top-level area (e.g. a new app, service, or major script), add a brief note to README and to the Project Overview above.

See `recipes/agents/readme-maintenance.md` for the full guide.

---

## Configuration Reference

The canonical configuration is in `.vibe/config.json`. Key fields are populated when you run `bin/vibe setup` (tracker, `github.owner`, `github.repo`, etc.). Example shape:

```json
{
 "tracker": { "type": "linear", "config": { "deployed_state": "Deployed" } },
 "github": { "auth_method": "gh_cli", "owner": "<your-org>", "repo": "<your-repo>" },
 "branching": { "pattern": "{PROJ}-{num}", "always_rebase": true },
 "labels": {
 "type": ["Bug", "Feature", "Chore", "Refactor"],
 "risk": ["Low Risk", "Medium Risk", "High Risk"],
 "area": ["Frontend", "Backend", "Infra", "Docs"],
 "special": ["HUMAN", "Milestone", "Blocked"]
 }
}
```

- **tracker.config.github_integration** (optional): `"native"` or `"fallback"`. Set during setup wizard.
  - `"native"` (recommended): Use Linear's native GitHub integration. The fallback workflows are not needed.
  - `"fallback"`: Use custom GitHub Actions workflows (`pr-opened.yml`, `pr-merged.yml`).
- **tracker.config.deployed_state** (optional): State name to use when a PR is merged (e.g. `Deployed`, `Done`, `Released`). Only used with fallback workflows.
- **tracker.config.in_review_state** (optional): State name when a PR is opened (default: `In Review`). Only used with fallback workflows.
- **tracker.config.done_state** (optional): Final "done" state name (e.g. `Done`, `Closed`). Used when UAT workflow is enabled—tickets go to `deployed_state` (e.g. `To Test`) on merge, then manually to `done_state` after verification. See `recipes/workflows/uat-testing.md`.

### Context Loading: Native vs Fallback Workflows

**IMPORTANT for AI agents:** Before referencing the fallback PR workflows, check the configuration:

```bash
# Check github_integration setting
cat .vibe/config.json | grep github_integration
```

- If `github_integration: "native"` → **Do NOT reference** `pr-opened.yml`, `pr-merged.yml`, or the fallback workflow recipes. These are not in use.
- If `github_integration: "fallback"` or not set → The fallback workflows are active and relevant.

This prevents loading unnecessary context about workflows that aren't being used.

## LLM-Powered Applications

When building applications that make API calls to LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), use **PromptVault** for prompt management.

### When to Use PromptVault

**Use PromptVault when the application:**
- Has prompts that will evolve over time
- Shares context or instructions across multiple prompts
- Needs version control for prompts
- Separates prompt engineering from code

**Skip PromptVault for:**
- One-off scripts or experiments
- Prompts that never change
- Applications without LLM API calls

### Quick Setup

```bash
# During initial setup
bin/vibe setup   # Select "Yes" for PromptVault when prompted

# Or add later
bin/vibe setup --wizard promptvault
```

### Usage Pattern

Instead of hardcoding prompts:

```python
# DON'T do this
prompt = "You are a helpful assistant for {company}. Help with: {query}"
```

Use PromptVault:

```python
# DO this
from your_app.prompts import get_compiled_prompt

prompt = get_compiled_prompt("customer-support", {
    "company": company_name,
    "query": user_query
})
```

See `recipes/integrations/promptvault.md` for full documentation and the `/promptvault` skill for scaffolding.

---

## Core Rules

### When to Ask for Clarification

**Always ask when:**
- Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory
- Multiple valid implementations exist with different trade-offs
- Security or data implications are unclear
- The task would take significant time if the wrong approach is chosen
- Destructive operations are involved

**Never ask when:**
- The answer is clearly in the codebase
- Standard patterns apply
- It's a trivial decision with easy reversal
- The question was already answered in context

See `recipes/agents/asking-clarifying-questions.md` for examples.

### When to Create HUMAN Tickets

The `HUMAN` label means "I cannot proceed without human action." Use it sparingly.

**DO create HUMAN tickets for:**
- Obtaining **actual secret values** (API keys, passwords the human must retrieve)
- External account actions (creating accounts on third-party services, enabling billing)
- Subjective decisions (UI/UX choices, branding, product direction)
- Legal/compliance review
- External communications (emails to users, public announcements)

**DO NOT create HUMAN tickets for:**
- Writing code or config files (even security-related code)
- Running CLI commands (`fly secrets set`, `gh secret set`, etc.)
- Setting up infrastructure (Dockerfiles, workflows, terraform)
- Documentation
- Architecture decisions (if requirements are clear, just implement)
- Installing dependencies or tools

**Ask yourself:** "Can I do this programmatically?" If yes, do it. If no, create a HUMAN ticket.

**Example:**
- "Provide DATABASE_URL" → HUMAN (need actual credential value)
- "Configure Fly.io secrets" → NOT HUMAN (you can run `fly secrets set`)
- "Write RLS policies" → NOT HUMAN (you can write the code)

See `recipes/agents/human-required-work.md` for the full guide.

### How to Handle Ambiguity

1. **Check context first** - Re-read the request, examine related code
2. **Make informed assumptions** - If confidence >80%, proceed with a note
3. **Ask with options** - Provide 2-3 specific options, not open-ended questions
4. **Document assumptions** - Note any assumptions in code comments or PR description

### File Editing

**No files in this repo are protected.** You may edit any file freely. Do not treat any path as read-only or off-limits; apply changes wherever they are needed to complete the task.

### Efficient Command Execution

**Prefer absolute paths and command-specific directory flags over `cd path && command`.** The latter causes sequential execution, resets shell working directory between commands, and adds unnecessary overhead.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| `cd /path && git status` | `git -C /path status` |
| `cd /path && git add . && git commit -m "..."` | `git -C /path add .` then `git -C /path commit -m "..."` (or one invocation with multiple args) |
| `cd /path && git push -u origin BRANCH` | `git -C /path push -u origin BRANCH` |
| `cd /path && npm install` | `npm --prefix /path install` |
| `cd /path && npm run build` | `npm --prefix /path run build` |
| `cd /path && gh pr create ...` | `gh pr create --repo owner/repo ...` (repo from main checkout or config; use `--head branch` if needed) |

**Worktree workflows:** When operating on a worktree (e.g. `../project-worktrees/PROJ-123`), use `git -C <worktree-path> ...` for all git commands from the main repo or from another shell. Use `gh pr create --repo owner/repo --head PROJ-123 ...` so you don't need to `cd` into the worktree to open the PR. This allows parallel or independent commands without changing directory.

---

## Ticket Management

### "Do this ticket {ticket}" – What it means

When the user says **"do this ticket PROJ-123"** (or any ticket ID), that means:

1. **Do the work on a fresh worktree** – Create a dedicated worktree for that ticket (`bin/vibe do PROJ-123`), do all work there (no work in the main checkout).
2. **Open a PR when complete** – When the work is done, commit, push, and open a PR (title with ticket ref, risk label, etc.). Do not leave the work only local.

So: **"do this ticket {ticket}"** = **do this ticket on a fresh worktree and open a PR when complete.**

### Ticketing System (Linear) Must Be Configured First

Before creating, listing, or fetching tickets, a tracker (e.g. Linear) must be configured in `.vibe/config.json`. If you or the user runs `bin/ticket create`, `bin/ticket list`, or `bin/ticket get` without a tracker configured:

- The CLI **pauses** and prints: "No ticketing system (e.g. Linear) is configured. Set up a tracker before creating or viewing tickets."
- It then prompts: **"Run tracker setup now?"** (default: yes).
- If the user confirms, it runs the tracker wizard (Linear/Shortcut/None), saves config, and the ticket command proceeds.
- If the user declines, it exits with a hint to run `bin/vibe setup` or `bin/vibe setup --wizard tracker` when ready.

When writing tickets or advising the user to create tickets, either ensure the project has already run `bin/vibe setup` (or `bin/vibe setup --wizard tracker`), or expect the interactive prompt and let the user complete it.

### Starting Work on a Ticket

When asked to "do" a ticket, use a fresh worktree and open a PR when done (see ["Do this ticket"](#do-this-ticket--ticket--what-it-means) above).

```bash
# Use the vibe CLI to create a worktree
bin/vibe do PROJ-123
```

This creates:
- A worktree at `../project-worktrees/PROJ-123/`
- A branch named according to the pattern (e.g., `PROJ-123`)

### Creating Tickets

When creating tickets programmatically:
1. **Check for duplicates first** — Search existing tickets (open and recently closed) for similar work before creating a new ticket. If a ticket already covers the same scope, update that ticket instead.
2. Use descriptive titles: "Verb + Object" format
3. **Apply labels** (see [Label checklist](#label-checklist-for-ticket-creation) below)
4. Include acceptance criteria
5. Link related tickets with **correct blocking direction** (see [Blocking relationships](#blocking-relationships) below)

#### Avoiding Duplicate Tickets

Before creating a new ticket, **always search** for existing tickets that might cover the same work:

```bash
bin/ticket list  # Review open tickets for overlap
```

**Signs of a duplicate:**
- Same component/area being modified
- Similar acceptance criteria
- Part of the same milestone or initiative
- Would result in conflicting changes if both were implemented

**If you find a potential duplicate:**
- Update the existing ticket with any new requirements
- Add a comment explaining the additional scope
- Do NOT create a new ticket

**If scopes overlap but aren't identical:**
- Consider if one ticket can be expanded to cover both
- If truly separate, document the boundary clearly in both tickets
- Link them with "related to" (not blocking)

#### Blocking relationships

Direction matters. The **prerequisite** (foundation) ticket **blocks** the dependent ticket — not the other way around.

- **"A blocks B"** = B cannot start until A is done. (A is the prerequisite.)
- **"A is blocked by B"** = A cannot start until B is done. (B is the prerequisite.)

**CORRECT:** "Initialize monorepo" BLOCKS "Set up React app"
(React app depends on monorepo being done first.)

**WRONG:** "Initialize monorepo" BLOCKED BY "Set up React app"
(That would mean monorepo can't start until React is done — backwards.)

When linking: set the **foundation ticket** as blocking the **dependent ticket(s)**. Do not set the foundation as "blocked by" the later tickets.

**When to use blocking:**
- True code dependencies (B imports from A, B needs A's API)
- HUMAN prerequisites (need credential value before next step)
- Sequential deployments (database migration before app deploy)

**When NOT to use blocking:**
- Parallel work on different files/components
- "Nice-to-have" ordering preferences
- Same milestone tickets (use milestone label instead)
- Related but independent features

**Keep the dependency graph shallow.** Deep chains slow down work. If you have A → B → C → D, consider if B and C can actually be parallel.

See `recipes/tickets/creating-tickets.md` for full guidance.

#### Label checklist for ticket creation

When creating a ticket, assign:

- **Type** (exactly one): Bug, Feature, Chore, Refactor
- **Risk** (exactly one): Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk
- **Area** (at least one): Frontend, Backend, Infra, Docs

Optional: **HUMAN**, **Milestone**, **Blocked** (see [Special Labels](#special-labels)).

#### Priority (Linear): use the Priority field, not labels

**Do not use P0, P1, P2, or P3 as labels.** Linear has a native **Priority** field. Set priority via that field so it works with Linear’s priority views and filters.

When creating or updating tickets, set the **Priority** field (not a label) using this mapping:

| If you mean | Set Linear Priority to |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| P0 / critical | **Urgent** |
| P1 / high | **High** |
| P2 / medium | **Medium** |
| P3 / low | **Low** |
| No priority | **No Priority** |

Labels in `.vibe/config.json` are for **type**, **risk**, and **area** only. Do not add P0/P1/P2/P3 to the label config.

### Ticket Status Updates

Update ticket status as work progresses:
- **Todo** → **In Progress**: When starting work
- **In Progress** → **In Review**: When PR is opened
- **In Review** → **Done**: When PR is merged

### Finding Actionable Tickets

When asked to "find unblocked tickets" or "look for work to do", follow this systematic triage process:

#### Step 1: Filter for candidates

```bash
bin/ticket list --status "Todo,Backlog"
```

Exclude tickets that are:
- Already **Done**, **Deployed**, **Canceled**, or **In Progress**
- Labeled **HUMAN** (requires human action)
- Blocked by other tickets (check `blockedBy` relationships)

#### Step 2: Validate each candidate

For each potential ticket, fetch details and check:

| Issue | Detection | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Actually blocked | Depends on work that doesn't exist yet | Add blocking relationship to prerequisite ticket |
| Already completed | Work already exists in codebase | Cancel ticket with comment explaining it's done |
| Requires human action | Needs external access, secrets, decisions | Add **HUMAN** label |
| Missing HUMAN label | Title starts with "HUMAN:" | Add **HUMAN** label for consistency |
| Stale/obsolete | Requirements no longer make sense | Cancel with explanation |

#### Step 3: Fix ticket hygiene issues

Before picking a ticket, fix any issues found:
- Add missing blocking relationships
- Cancel completed tickets (with comment)
- Add **HUMAN** labels where needed
- Update stale descriptions

#### Step 4: Pick highest-priority actionable ticket

Priority order:
1. **Milestone priority** - v1 before v2/Future
2. **Ticket number** - Lower numbers first (within same milestone)
3. **Foundation work** - Prerequisites before dependent work
4. **Risk level** - Lower risk first (for quick wins)

#### Example triage report

```
## Ticket Triage Report

### Actionable (3)
1. PROJ-101 - Add user authentication (Medium Risk, Backend)
2. PROJ-105 - Create API endpoint for /users (Low Risk, Backend)
3. PROJ-108 - Add input validation (Low Risk, Backend)

### Fixed during triage
- PROJ-102: Added blocking relationship (blocked by PROJ-101)
- PROJ-106: Canceled - feature already exists in codebase
- PROJ-107: Added HUMAN label - requires AWS account setup

### Still blocked (2)
- PROJ-102 - Add login page (blocked by PROJ-101)
- PROJ-110 - Deploy to production (blocked by PROJ-108, PROJ-109)

**Recommendation:** Start with PROJ-105 (lowest risk, no blockers)
```

### HUMAN Follow-Up for Deployment Infrastructure

When a deployment infrastructure ticket is completed (e.g. added `fly.toml`, `vercel.json`, `.env.example`), create a **HUMAN-labeled follow-up ticket** so a human can set up production accounts and deploy. Use:

- **Manual:** `bin/ticket create-human-followup` (optionally `--parent PROJ-123` or `--files fly.toml --files vercel.json`)
- **Auto:** The workflow `.github/workflows/human-followup-on-deployment.yml` creates the ticket on merge to main when deployment config files were added (requires repo secrets `LINEAR_API_KEY`, `LINEAR_TEAM_ID`)

See `recipes/tickets/human-followup-deployment.md` for full guidance.

---

## Worktree Management

**Agent rule:** When the user asks to clean up worktrees, branches, or "tidy up" local state, follow the [Cleaning Up Worktrees](#cleaning-up-worktrees--follow-this-order) steps (remove worktrees first, then delete branches, then run `bin/vibe doctor`). Do not skip steps.

### Creating Worktrees

```bash
bin/vibe do PROJ-123
```

This creates a worktree (path from config, typically `../<repo>-worktrees/PROJ-123`) and a branch for that ticket.

### When to Clean Up Worktrees

**Clean up a worktree when:**
- The PR for that ticket has been **merged** to main (or the branch is no longer needed), or
- The user asks to "clean up branches/worktrees" or "tidy up".

**Do not remove a worktree** while the branch is still in use (open PR, WIP, or user is working there).

### Cleaning Up Worktrees — Follow This Order

Agents and users **must** do these steps in order whenever cleaning up after a merged PR or doing a general cleanup:

1. **Remove the worktree** (from the **main** repo checkout, not from inside the worktree):
   ```bash
   git worktree remove <path-to-worktree>
   ```
   Path is usually relative to the repo root, e.g. `../<repo>-worktrees/PROJ-123`. Use `git worktree list` to see exact paths. If the worktree has uncommitted changes and you're sure they're not needed: `git worktree remove --force <path>`.

2. **Delete the local branch** (only after the worktree is removed):
   ```bash
   git branch -d PROJ-123
   ```
   Use `-D` if the branch was merged via a merge commit and git reports "not fully merged".

3. **Sync local state** so `.vibe/local_state.json` matches reality:
   ```bash
   bin/vibe doctor
   ```

### One-Time Cleanup of Multiple Worktrees/Branches

When the user asks to "clean up local branches and worktrees":

1. From the **main** repo, run `git worktree list` and note every worktree that is **not** the main repo.
2. For each such worktree: `git worktree remove <path>` (or `--force` if needed).
3. Delete obsolete local branches (e.g. merged feature branches): `git branch -d <branch>` or `git branch -D <branch>`.
4. Run `bin/vibe doctor` to fix `.vibe/local_state.json`.

### Active Worktree State

Worktrees are tracked in `.vibe/local_state.json` (gitignored). Stale entries cause confusion; **always run `bin/vibe doctor`** after adding or removing worktrees so that state stays accurate.

---

## Multi-Agent Coordination

When multiple AI agents work on the same codebase, follow these rules:

1. **Use worktree isolation** - Each agent MUST use its own worktree (`bin/vibe do PROJ-123`)
2. **Check what's in flight** - Run `git fetch --all && git branch -r` before starting
3. **Avoid high-risk files** - `CLAUDE.md`, `package.json`, migrations are conflict-prone
4. **Coordinate via tracker** - Keep tickets "In Progress" so others see claimed work

See `recipes/workflows/multi-agent-coordination.md` for full details on situational awareness, conflict prevention, and communication signals.

## Label Documentation

### Type Labels
| Label | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| **Bug** | Fixing broken functionality |
| **Feature** | Adding new functionality |
| **Chore** | Maintenance, dependencies, cleanup |
| **Refactor** | Code improvement, no behavior change |

### Risk Labels
| Label | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Low Risk** | Docs, tests, typos, minor UI tweaks |
| **Medium Risk** | New features (flagged), bug fixes, refactoring |
| **High Risk** | Auth, payments, database, infrastructure |

### Area Labels
| Label | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Frontend** | UI, client-side code |
| **Backend** | Server, API, business logic |
| **Infra** | DevOps, CI/CD, infrastructure |
| **Docs** | Documentation only |

### Special Labels
| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **HUMAN** | Requires human decision/action |
| **Milestone** | Part of a larger feature |
| **Blocked** | Waiting on external dependency |

### Milestones

- **Option A (recommended):** Use the **Milestone** label on tickets that are part of a larger feature, and link related tickets (blocks/blocked-by or parent/child). Keeps 1 ticket = 1 PR and works across trackers.
- **Option B:** Use Linear/Shortcut native milestones when the team already plans with them.

See `recipes/tickets/creating-tickets.md` for details.

## GitHub Actions Results

### Understanding CI Failures

**Always read the actual failure first.** Do not guess the cause from workflow names or assumptions.

1. **PR comments and review threads** – CodeQL and other checks post inline comments (e.g. from `github-advanced-security`). Read them to see the exact finding (e.g. "Incomplete URL substring sanitization") and the file/line.
2. **Failed run logs** – `gh pr checks <number>` to see which check failed; then `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed` (or open the failed job in the GitHub Checks tab) to read the error output.
3. **PR policy bot comment** – If the bot commented on the PR, it lists missing items (ticket reference, risk label, etc.).

Only after you know the real failure (e.g. "CodeQL alert on line 45", "missing risk label", "test X failed") should you fix it. See below for common workflows and responses.

When a workflow fails, check:

1. **security.yml**
   - Gitleaks: Secret detected in code
   - Dependency review: Vulnerable dependency in PR
   - CodeQL: Security finding in code (see PR review comments from github-advanced-security for file/line and query name, e.g. `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`)

2. **pr-policy.yml**
   - Missing ticket reference in PR
   - Missing risk label
   - Branch naming violation

3. **pr-opened.yml** (fallback - prefer native Linear GitHub integration)
   - Runs when a PR is opened or reopened; updates the Linear ticket (from branch name) to "In Review" state. Requires repo secret `LINEAR_API_KEY`. Optional repo variable `LINEAR_IN_REVIEW_STATE` (default: `In Review`). On failure, logs a warning and does not fail the job.
   - **Note**: If using Linear's native GitHub integration (recommended), this workflow is not needed. See `recipes/tickets/linear-github-integration.md`.

4. **pr-merged.yml** (fallback - prefer native Linear GitHub integration)
   - Runs when a PR is merged; updates the Linear ticket (from branch name) to the "deployed" state. Requires repo secret `LINEAR_API_KEY`. Optional repo variable `LINEAR_DEPLOYED_STATE` (default: `Deployed`). On failure (e.g. no API key, ticket not found), logs a warning and does not fail the job.
   - **Note**: If using Linear's native GitHub integration (recommended), this workflow is not needed. See `recipes/tickets/linear-github-integration.md`.

5. **tests.yml** (if tests exist)
   - Test failure (check output for details)
   - No tests detected (may be intentional for new projects)

### Responding to CI Failures

**Secret detected:**
1. Remove the secret from code
2. If intentional, add to `.vibe/secrets.allowlist.json`
3. Rotate the exposed secret

**Missing labels:**
1. Add the required label via GitHub UI or `gh pr edit`

**CodeQL / security findings** (see PR review comments for the exact alert):
1. Read the inline comment: query ID, file, line, and "Show more details" link
2. Fix the finding (e.g. avoid URL substring checks in tests; use allowlists in production code) or add a documented suppression if it is a false positive
3. Push the fix

**Test failures** (if the project has tests):
1. Read the failure output (from logs or `gh run view ... --log-failed`)
2. Fix the failing test or the code
3. Push the fix

## Common Patterns

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Get ticket details
bin/ticket get PROJ-123

# 2. Create worktree
bin/vibe do PROJ-123

# 3. Work in the worktree (or use absolute path for commands from elsewhere)
WORKTREE=../project-worktrees/PROJ-123  # or absolute path
# ... implement feature in that directory ...

# 4. Commit and push (from anywhere, using git -C)
git -C "$WORKTREE" add .
git -C "$WORKTREE" commit -m "PROJ-123: Add feature description"
git -C "$WORKTREE" push -u origin PROJ-123

# 5. Create PR (no cd needed; use --repo and --head)
gh pr create --repo owner/repo --head PROJ-123 --title "PROJ-123: Add feature" --body "..."
```

### Fixing a Bug

```bash
# 1. Create worktree
bin/vibe do PROJ-456

# 2. Fix the bug in the worktree (e.g. cd there to edit, or use your editor with the path)
# ... make changes in ../project-worktrees/PROJ-456 ...

# 3. Add tests that would have caught it
# 4. Commit with bug ticket reference (git -C from anywhere)
git -C ../project-worktrees/PROJ-456 commit -m "PROJ-456: Fix null pointer in auth flow"
```

### Handling CI Failures

**First:** Read the actual failure. Check PR comments (e.g. CodeQL inline comments from github-advanced-security), PR policy bot comment, and failed run logs. Do not guess from workflow names.

```bash
# 1. See which check failed
gh pr checks <number>

# 2. Read failed run logs (use run ID from the failed check link)
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed

# 3. If tests failed (and the project has tests), run locally
pytest  # or npm test, etc.

# 3. If secret scanning failed
# Review .vibe/secrets.allowlist.json

# 4. Fix and push
git push
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't guess CI failures** - Read PR comments (CodeQL, policy bot) and failed run logs first
2. **Don't merge main into feature branches** - Always rebase
3. **Don't force push to main** - Only to feature branches
4. **Don't skip CI** - Wait for checks to pass
5. **Don't commit secrets** - Even for "testing"
6. **Don't skip risk labels** - Every PR needs one
7. **Don't create PRs without ticket references** - Link to tickets
8. **Don't work in the main checkout** - Use worktrees for ticket work.
9. **Don't leave merged worktrees around** - After a PR is merged, remove the worktree, delete the local branch, and run `bin/vibe doctor`.
10. **Don't use `cd path && command`** - Use `git -C path`, `npm --prefix path`, or `gh pr create --repo owner/repo` so commands can run without changing directory and can be parallelized when appropriate.

## When Things Go Wrong

### Rebase Conflicts
```bash
git rebase --abort  # Start over
# Or resolve and continue:
git add <resolved-files>
git rebase --continue
```

### Accidentally Committed a Secret
1. Remove from code immediately
2. Push the fix
3. Rotate the secret at its source
4. Consider adding to allowlist if it's actually public

### Worktree in Bad State
```bash
# From the main repo: force remove the worktree
git worktree remove --force <path-from-git-worktree-list>
# Delete the branch if needed
git branch -D PROJ-123
# Recreate if you still need to work on that ticket
bin/vibe do PROJ-123
```
See [Cleaning Up Worktrees](#cleaning-up-worktrees--follow-this-order) for the full cleanup procedure.

### CORS Errors

When you see CORS errors (browser blocking API requests):

1. **Diagnose first:**
   ```bash
   bin/vibe cors-check https://api.example.com/endpoint -o http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Check the output** for missing headers and specific suggestions.

3. **Apply framework-specific fix** from `recipes/debugging/cors-errors.md`.

Common quick fixes:
- **Missing headers entirely**: Add CORS middleware to your server
- **Wrong origin**: Add your frontend's URL to allowed origins
- **Credentials issue**: Can't use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins
